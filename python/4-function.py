# Important warning: The default value is evaluated only once. 
# This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object 
# such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. 
# For example, the following function accumulates the arguments 
# passed to it on subsequent calls:
def f2(a, L=[]):
    L.append(a)
    return L
# the following will print
# [1]
# [1, 2]
# [1, 2, 3]
print(f2(1))
print(f2(2))
print(f2(3))

# If you donâ€™t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, 
# you can write the function like this instead:
def f3(a, L=None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
